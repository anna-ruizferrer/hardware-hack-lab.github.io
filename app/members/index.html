		<h1>Who are our members?</h1>
		<p>A mix of artists, engineers, students, designers and well, straight-up nerds. We make a free and friendly space every Wednesday, with people, equipment and a good vibe. Some of our members are new to tech, others have been doing it a lifetime. Some drop by on occasion, others are here every week.</p>
		<p>If you like the sound of that, please <a href="/join">drop by and visit</a>.</p>
