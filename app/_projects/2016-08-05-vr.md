For the past three months, a team of ThoughtWorks designers and technologists have been working with virtual reality to make technology-mediated communication less dehumanized.  Using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.htcvive.com/us/">HTC Vive</a>, and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www3.oculus.com/en-us/rift/">Oculus Rift</a>, they’ve developed a remote-collaboration framework that allows users to high-five, express ideas as objects in 3D space, and even play Pictionary from opposite sides of the country.

The idea for the app came out of a two-day ThoughtWorks workshop focused on the business opportunities virtual and augmented reality presented.  Over the course of this workshop, it became clear that VR had a unique value proposition in the area of remote collaboration, a concern shared by nearly all of ThoughtWorks’ clients.

Because VR alters one’s sense of place and presence, the team felt there was an opportunity to use it to improve on the current state of remote collaboration.  They knew they wanted to develop something that afforded a more human mode of expression than was possible with Google Hangouts.

Technology, though it has made remote communication easier, has in general tended to dehumanize the way we communicate and collaborate.  Most remote communication is done over email or video chat - media and interfaces that force one to type words out on a keyboard and interact with others through a flat screen.

Kent Rahman, a UX designer with ThoughtWorks, saw in VR several years ago the potential to reverse this trend.  This all started as a passion project of his, and he wanted to investigate how VR could be designed to improve collaboration tools used in the office.

“Designers have a moral obligation to make tools people use for their jobs enjoyable and delightful, because we’re influencing workers’ happiness,” he says.  “It’s important to treat users like human beings.”

While on a project at an education technology company in 2014, he noticed how technology affected communication between students and teachers.  For instance, students uncomfortable speaking up in class could communicate with their teacher using iPad software ThoughtWorks had built. This same capability - the ability to communicate in non-verbal ways - is what Rahman recognized VR could provide in ways no existing technology could.

Things really came together when Rahman was playing around with LeapMotion.  There were two demos, he says, that gave him this idea: one for drawing in 3D by pinching one’s fingers together, and another for scaling virtual objects with one’s hands.  He realized that this ability to create and manipulate objects would be perfect for remote communication in VR.

This ability is at the center of (NAME OF APP), the result of these last few months of experimentation by the team at ThoughtWorks.  (NAME OF APP), coded in C#, is a bare-bones set of functionality designed to satisfy all the basic needs of a networked VR app: two people can inhabit the same virtual space and see each others’ avatars, communicate via voice, and draw shapes with their own hands.

The team - composed of developers Allie Quintano and Nick Maxwell, designers Heyoung Kim and Christopher Edwards, strategist Neil Redding, and technologist Rachel Laycock - has plans to release the app to the community the coming weeks.

They also plan on continuing to improve the app.  As soon as they figured out how to draw, they started working on the problem of representing dynamic systems in VR.  Right now, in order to create a visualization of a dynamic system (like a supply chain), one would have to use 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview">Maya</a> or
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html">Adobe After Effects</a>.  A virtual space, however, affords many ways of creating objects, moving them around, and relating them to one another.

This problem represents another concern that cuts across all industries ThoughtWorks works with - how to take complex problems about dynamic systems and find abstract, simplified ways of representing them.  Currently, tasks like this are done using whiteboards and post-it notes, but the team is looking into ways they can lever the possibilities of virtual space to solve these problems.

One feature they are starting to work on is the ability to create objects, scale them, and have them move around the virtual space in a loop.  Such objects could, for example, symbolize components of an international supply chain.

There are other possibilities, too, like data visualization.  For instance, a book might have an illustration of the tallest skyscrapers in the world, at relative scale.  But it would be even easier to create a virtual space that features these buildings right next to each other, at their actual size.  This is new technology to most everyone on the team, so there’s been a lot of learning and unstructured experimentation along the way.

It didn’t take long, however, for the team to notice the potential VR had for fostering a sense of empathy and connection.  “It’s amazing,” Rahman says.  “The first thing people want to do in VR is high five each other.  It brings out a natural curiosity in people.  They immediately start exploring the environment and expressing themselves within it.  There’s something really powerful and intangible in the knowledge you share a virtual space with another person.”

<p class="image-caption">The "thumbs up" signal from all participants starts the meeting.</p>

One concept the team quickly seized upon was that of “ambient utility,” the virtual environment’s ability to provide utility through its design.  For instance, one of their prototypes is a virtual meeting that takes place among mountains and forests.  When all the participants give a thumbs up sign, a bell sounds and the sun rises.  As the time allotted for the meeting draws to a close, the sun begins to set, providing a naturalistic, highly intuitive cue to participants that they should finish their discussion.

They have also been learning about what it’s like to develop software for VR.  Since VR development hasn’t been around for very long, the industry lacks a consensus on topics such as testing and continuous integration pipelines.  The team hopes to establish a set of best practices for VR development.

It’s impossible to predict how new technology, especially something as revolutionary as VR, will end up being used.  Rahman says there’s a very slim chance that (NAME OF APP) is the future of remote collaboration.  However, he says, “There’s something really satisfying about just trying to prove that there is a way in which it can be used… picking a direction and just going with it.”


This is exactly what artists who use technology as a medium do with their work - explore the hypothetical uses of technology and ask questions about our relationship with technology.
